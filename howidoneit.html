                <p>My teacher, Mr. Mc Gee, assigned this as a project for his class on May 1st, 2025. He instructed us to add two pages to our website: one where we had to do something we hadn't done before, and one explaining our process and thought process. He then had the class pick what the new thing we would do/add would be and we deciden on making an object or some text bounce.</p><br>
                <p>I decided that I want to make this shark emoji I have been using throughout my website for special features as my image to make bounce. Below is the shark emoji, for reference.</p>
                <img src="./shark.png">
                <p>Weve done a handful of projects that involve moving pieces, so I've mostly been "frankenstein-ing" pieces of code from older projects together. Some of these such projects include our projects in p5.js and codinga rocket that follows your mouse in html. Mostly I have been creating my own code based off of what we have learned in p5.js and copy-paste-ing snippets of code from the rocker project.</p> <br>
                <p>(05/02/2025 11:07am)<br>Currently I have gotten the shark to move, but it's going in the wrong direction and I need to get it to go in the right direction, then bounce off of invisible boundaries.</p><br>
                <p>(05/02/2025 11:11am)<br>Okay, now I've gotten it to go somewhat in the right direction? It doesn't immediately turn and fly offscreen, but it is just quickly shootin up and down towards the approximate direction I want it to go in.</p><br>
                <p>(5/9/2025 10:37)<br>Okay, I had to pause this project to work on other things, but I'm back to working on it. I now have the shark facing the right direction and slowed down a good bit, but it is only moving from left to right on the screen but not up or down. It's just going from the left to the right very, very slowly.</p><br>
                <p>(5/9/2025 10:59)<br>I may just have to leave it like that...</p>
