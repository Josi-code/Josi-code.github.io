            My name is Jocelyn Carron, but most people call me Josi.

            I am concurrently enrolled in Pikes Peak State College and going for my Associates of Applied Science in Computer Aided Drafting: Mechanical Engineering, but I am hoping they will bring back the Computer Aided Drafting: Robotics and Automation program.

            I have many hobbies, but my favorites are crochet, reading, and leather working.
